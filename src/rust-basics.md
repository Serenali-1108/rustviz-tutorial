# Rust Basics

## Main Function
In every executuable Rust program, the `main` function contains the code that
will execute first:
```rust
fn main() {
    //code here will run first
}
```
## Variables
In Rust, we use `let` bindings to introduce variables. Variables are *mutable*
or *immutable*.

### Immutable Variables
By default, variables are *immutable* in Rust. This means that once a value is
bound to the variable, the binding cannot be changed. We use `let` bindings to
introduce immutable variables as follows:
```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5;
}
```
In this example, we introduce a variable `x` of type `i32`(a 32-bit signed
integer type) and bind the value `5` to it. 

Since the binding cannot be changed for an immutable variable, the following
example causes a compiler error:
```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    x = 6; //ERROR
}
```

### Immutable Variables
Sometimes, we want to allow the binding of a variable to change. In order to do
this in Rust, we introduce *mutable* variables with `let mut` rather than `let`:
```rust
fn main() {
    let mut x = 5;
    x = 6; //OK
}
```

## Copies
For simple types like integers, assigning the value of a variable causes
the value to be copied. In this example, we bind the value `5` to `x` and then
assign the value of `x` to `y` which makes a copy `x`'s value:
```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    let y = x;
}
```

Note that this is only relevant for simple types like integers or other types
that have been marked as copyableâ€”we'll discuss how more interesting data
structures behave differently in later sections of the tutorial.

## Functions
Besides `main`, we can define additional functions. In the following example, 
we define a function called `plus_one` which takes an `i32` as input returns an
`i32` with the value that is one more than the input:
```rust
fn main() {
    let six = plus_one(5);
}

fn five(x: i32) -> i32 {
    x + 1
}
```

Notice how there is no explicit return. In Rust, the last expression in the
function body is the return value. (Rust also has a `return` keyword, but we
do not use it here.)

## Printing to the Terminal
In Rust, we can print to the terminal using `println!`:
```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!")
}
```

We can also use curly brackets in the input string of `println!` as a
placeholder for certain values:
```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 1;
    let y = 2;
    println!("x = {} and y = {}", x, y);
}
```

Note that `println!` is a *macro*, not a function. This means that it behaves
slightly differently from normal functions, but you do not need to worry about
that for this tutorial.
