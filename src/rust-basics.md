# Rust Basics

- main function
- let binding with integers
- let mut with integers (can't reassign if it is not mutable)
- copy in here (hint that this is only relevant for simple types like int or other types that have been marked as copyable, we'll consider how more interesting data structures behave differently in the remaining sections of the tutorial)
- define another function
  - point out that there is no explicit return

  

- how to use println! [note that it is a macro, not a function, but dont worry about that for this tutorial]
