# Rust Basics

- main function
- let binding with integers
- let mut with integers (can't reassign if it is not mutable)
- define another function
  - point out that everything is an expression (no explicit return)
- how to use println! [note that it is a macro, not a function, but dont worry about that for this tutorial]
